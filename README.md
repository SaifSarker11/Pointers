# Pointers

## Description
This project contains a collection of C programs demonstrating various concepts related to pointers in C programming. Each section showcases different pointer operations, including arithmetic, comparisons, array manipulations, and more.

## Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the programs, use a C compiler like GCC.

For example:
```
gcc pointers.c -o pointers
./pointers
```

Note: The file contains multiple `main` functions. To run a specific example, comment out the other `main` functions and their associated code.

## Examples

1. **Pointer Arithmetic and Increment/Decrement**: Demonstrates post-increment, pre-increment on pointers and dereferenced values.

2. **Pointer Comparisons**: Compares values pointed to by pointers.

3. **Looping with Pointers**: Uses pointers to iterate through an array.

4. **Printing Addresses**: Displays memory addresses of different data types.

5. **Finding Max and Min**: Functions to find maximum and minimum values in an array using pointers.

6. **GCD and LCM Calculation**: Computes GCD and LCM using pointers.

7. **Computing Mean**: Calculates the mean of an array.

8. **Finding Median**: Sorts an array and finds the median.

9. **Finding Mode**: Sorts an array and finds the mode.

10. **Palindrome Check**: Checks if a string is a palindrome using pointers.

11. **Another Palindrome Check**: Similar to above, with slight variations.

12. **String Reversal**: Reverses a string using pointers.

13. **Sorting Applicants**: Sorts a list of applicants based on some criteria.

14. **Array Shifting**: Shifts array elements left or right by a specified amount.

## Requirements
- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Standard C libraries (stdio.h, string.h, ctype.h, stdbool.h)

## Usage
Uncomment the desired `main` function and comment out the others to run a specific example.
